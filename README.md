# AI Job Hiring Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)
## Role: Data Analyst
This project demonstrates my practical work as a Data Analyst: I collected, cleaned, and visualized job-listing data to reveal hiring trends for AI roles across companies, locations, and time. The dashboard was built end-to-end in Power BI, focusing on actionable insights for job seekers, hiring managers, and data-savvy professionals.

## Project Objective
The objective is to create an interactive dashboard that answers business questions about the AI hiring market and helps users quickly understand:

•	Which companies are actively hiring for AI roles and when

•	Salary trends by experience and role

•	Remote vs on-site hiring patterns

•	Skills, experience and benefit expectations across roles and industries

•	Urgent / time-sensitive opportunities (based on application deadlines)
