## AI Job Hiring Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)
# Role: Data Analyst
This project demonstrates my practical work as a Data Analyst: I collected, cleaned, and visualized job-listing data to reveal hiring trends for AI roles across companies, locations, and time. The dashboard was built end-to-end in Power BI, focusing on actionable insights for job seekers, hiring managers, and data-savvy professionals.
